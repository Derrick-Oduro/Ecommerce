### Documentation

The ecommerce site was made with react for the frontend while I used express for the backend which was quite simple and efficient, and for the database I used MySQL which was a must use since that was the standard one being thought in school.
Most of the tasks were completed by me with a few members contributing so the detailing became a problem

This README provides a clear and concise guide for setting up and running both the backend and frontend of your project.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
